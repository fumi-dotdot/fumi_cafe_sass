//NOTE: rem: This unit is relative to the font size of the root element (<html>). It remains consistent across the document, providing a reliable baseline for sizing.=>stick to rem for font-size
//NOTE: em: This unit is relative to the font size of its parent element. Its value can vary depending on the inheritance chain, making it more flexible but sometimes less predictable. â€»for padding/margin, it is referencing the font size of that element, not of the parent.
// NOTE: px for sizing is not recommended as it does not respond to change of browser base font size.
// use of vw alone to define font size: it looks at only viewport width, so you cannot zoom in or out - accessibility issue
// combination of rem + vw makes the transition less dramatic
